    "# ODSC 2025 RAG + Structured Generation with Outlines\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll be covering how to use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to search for product reviews relevant to a question and then generate structured data from the reviews. We'll have well-structured data at the end that we can use for later analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use RAG (via [Milvus](https://milvus.io/)) to search for product reviews relevant to a question\n",
    "- Use LLMs and [Outlines](https://github.com/dottxt-ai/outlines) to generate structured data from the reviews to understand sentiment for various categories\n",
    "- Visualize the results using PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the dataset\n",
    "2. Preprocess the data\n",
    "3. Set up the vector database for RAG\n",
    "4. Use LLMs and Outlines to generate structured data from the reviews\n",
    "5. Visualize the results using PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, let's define a few terms. Some of you may not be familiar with all of these terms, but that's okay! We'll be using them throughout the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG stands for retrieval-augmented generation. It's a technique that allows us to use a large language model (LLM) to generate text that is relevant to a specific question. For example, we can use RAG to search for product reviews that are relevant to a question like \"How do people feel about our prices?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a good way to find text that is \"similar\" to a question, and placing it into a language model's context window so that the model can use it to generate a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outlines + structured generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlines is an open-source framework for structured generation. Structured generation is a technique that allows us to use a large language model (LLM) to generate text that is structured in a specific way. For example, we can use structured generation to generate a list of categories that a user's experience falls into and provide a sentiment for each category.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to install the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install \"pymilvus[model]\" \"outlines[transformers]\" datasets sentence-transformers scikit-learn matplotlib pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also install the package from the `requirements.txt` file in the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be working with a dataset of Amazon reviews for video games, provided by the [McAuley Lab](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/McAuley-Lab/Amazon-Reviews-2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll load the dataset using the `datasets` library. It may take a few seconds to download, so please be sure to start it early. It took me about 1.5 minutes to download the dataset."
