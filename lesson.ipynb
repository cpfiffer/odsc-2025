    "# ODSC 2025 RAG + Structured Generation with Outlines\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll be covering how to use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to search for product reviews relevant to a question and then generate structured data from the reviews. We'll have well-structured data at the end that we can use for later analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use RAG (via [Milvus](https://milvus.io/)) to search for product reviews relevant to a question\n",
    "- Use LLMs and [Outlines](https://github.com/dottxt-ai/outlines) to generate structured data from the reviews to understand sentiment for various categories\n",
    "- Visualize the results using PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the dataset\n",
    "2. Preprocess the data\n",
    "3. Set up the vector database for RAG\n",
    "4. Use LLMs and Outlines to generate structured data from the reviews\n",
    "5. Visualize the results using PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who am I?\n",
    "\n",
    "My name is Cameron Pfiffer. I am a developer relations engineer at .txt, the maintainers of the open source package Outlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "I work on showing people how to build robust AI applications using structured generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a person: I am a rower, pianist, cyclist, software tinkerer, and hammock-lover.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, let's define a few terms. Some of you may not be familiar with all of these terms, but that's okay! We'll be using them throughout the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG stands for retrieval-augmented generation. It's a technique that allows us to use a large language model (LLM) to generate text that is relevant to a specific question. For example, we can use RAG to search for product reviews that are relevant to a question like \"How do people feel about our prices?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a good way to find text that is \"similar\" to a question, and placing it into a language model's context window so that the model can use it to generate a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is useful because it can reduce hallucinations and help the model provide relevant information. Most business applications for language models will benefit from some form of retrieval augmented generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outlines + structured generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlines is an open-source framework for structured generation. Structured generation is a technique that allows us to use a large language model (LLM) to generate text that is structured in a specific way. For example, we can use structured generation to generate a list of categories that a user's experience falls into and provide a sentiment for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, using the code\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chooser = outlines.generate.choice(\n",
    "    model, \n",
    "    ['cats', 'dogs']\n",
    ")\n",
    "chooser(\"Are cats or dogs better?\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "means that the model will __only__ return either \"cats\" or \"dogs\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Outlines guarantees that the model output cannot deviate from that format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is structured generation useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most text has some form of structure. Text that tends to be used in computing has especially well-structured formats, like JSON:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    'name':'Cameron Pfiffer',\n",
    "    'age': 31\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON has strict requirements about formatting, such as \n",
    "\n",
    "- Objects must begin and end with `{` and `}`\n",
    "- Object keys must begin and end with either `'` or `\"`\n",
    "- Keys and values are separated by a `:`\n",
    "- Values must be strings, floats, integers, null, objects, or arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlines can be used to enforce model output structure to valid JSON. This means that your language model output will __always__ be consistently machine-readable!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A common Outlines workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "We typically define output structure using Pydantic:"

If you're running this for the first time, you will need to allow the server to download the model."

The sheer size and depth of the world (and it's gameplay) seems incredible.<br /><br />As a huge fan of the Zelda series I was hoping this game would be something special.. and that most definitely seems to be the case!\n"
